# WorldAtlas

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-Vercel-success?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel)](https://worldatlas-yasir.vercel.app)

A React country-explorer app — search, filter, and sort through 195+ nations, and drill into a detailed profile for each one. Built on the [REST Countries v5 API](https://restcountries.com/docs) and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## What I Learned in This Project

1. **React Router DOM (Page Navigation)**:
   - How to set up a data router with `createBrowserRouter` and `<RouterProvider />`, with nested `children` routes.
   - How to pass dynamic values in the URL using `useParams` (e.g., `/country/:id` to load a single country's details).
   - How to create a shared layout with nested pages using `<Outlet />` — the header and footer stay mounted while `AppLayout` swaps out the page content (Home, About, Country, Contact) inside it.
   - How to build "Read More" and "Go Back" navigation using `<NavLink />`, including styling the active link differently from inactive ones.
   - How to show a friendly error screen (`errorElement` + `useRouteError`) when a route fails or doesn't match.

2. **Fetching Data with Axios**:
   - How to create a reusable Axios instance (`axios.create`) with a `baseURL` and a shared `Authorization` header, instead of repeating config on every call.
   - How to call a third-party REST API (REST Countries v5) with query params (`response_fields`, `limit`) for both a list endpoint and a "read by property" endpoint (`/names.common/:name`) for a single country.
   - How to unwrap a nested JSON:API-style response (`res.data.data.objects`) safely.

3. **Handling Loading, Error, and Empty States**:
   - How to use `useTransition` + `startTransition` to fetch data inside `useEffect` without blocking the UI, and show a loading spinner (`isPending`) while the request is in flight.
   - How to wrap API calls in `try/catch` and store the error in state so the UI can show a fallback message instead of crashing.
   - How to use optional chaining (`?.`) and fallback values (`|| "N/A"`) to safely render fields that some countries don't have (missing capital, currency, or flag).

4. **Derived State & Client-Side Filtering**:
   - How to implement live search, region filtering, and A–Z/Z–A sorting on a list purely with `useState` and array methods (`.filter`, `.sort`, `.localeCompare`) — no extra API calls needed.
   - How to combine multiple independent filters (search text + region dropdown) by chaining filter conditions.

5. **Component Composition & Reusability**:
   - How to break a page into small, focused components (`CountryCard`, `SearchFilter`, `Loader`, `Headers`, `Footers`) that each take props and render one piece of UI.
   - How to keep a single component (`CountryCard`) reusable across a dynamic list rendered with `.map()`.

## Features

- **Home page** with a hero section and a curated "Interesting Facts" showcase of countries.
- **Country directory** listing every country with flag, population, region, and capital at a glance.
- **Live search** — filter the country list by name as you type.
- **Region filter** — narrow the list down to Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, or Oceania.
- **A–Z / Z–A sorting** — sort the country list alphabetically in either direction.
- **Country details page** — official name, native names, population, region/sub-region, capital(s), top-level domain, currencies, and languages for a single country.
- **Graceful handling of incomplete data** — countries missing a capital, flag, or currency (e.g. some territories) render "N/A" instead of crashing.
- **Contact page** with a simple validated form.
- **Responsive navigation** — collapses into a hamburger drawer menu on mobile.
- **Loading and error states** — a spinner while data is in flight, and friendly fallback messaging if a request fails.
- **Fully responsive layout** — mobile-first grid/flex layouts across every page.
